This is designed to be dynamic for the most part (can fit different phones) with sliding adjustments

### Hand held stand

While this is custom designed for this phone (and one for iPhone 14 pro max), the concept is the same for other phones.

The simple design below can be used as a base regarding the paddle/rotating mechanism.

### "Popsicle stick" stand

This one is the simplest/fastest to print. It's nice because it be used for pretty much any phone. You can see here that I temporarily taped it to the phone.

### Permanent clip

This is a sign of madness

The point of this was so that I wouldn't have to take the monocle out of the case/position it over my eye just right every time I used it... During the process of prototyping many (~30) of these clips, I snapped the clip off. So I had to print the ring thing to hold it... anyway positive is I brought the image up/eye level vs. looking down (original) but the text is blurrier/farthest near corner text has doubling, redish tint in some areas near middle. It has a janky magnetic charger too.

Would I recommend? no
