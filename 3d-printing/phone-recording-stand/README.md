### Phone Recording Stand

The monocle is really hard to film IMO. It is best IMO to film it with your phone's macro feature.

So this is a stand that holds your phone upright/right against the monocle viewing area.

So you can record the monocle's display as you program it wirelessly via say the web repl.
