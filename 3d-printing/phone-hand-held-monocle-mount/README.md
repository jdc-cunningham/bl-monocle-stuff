### About

This is a monocle stand that slides over your phone and allows you to record through the monocle as if being worn by an eye... specifically this one is mobile, it's not designed to be sat on a desk.

So if you want to record say an AR workflow with the monocle, you can use this.

Unfortunately phone designs vary and this one was designed around a Moto G although it has adjustable features.
