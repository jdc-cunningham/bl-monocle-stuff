### About

<img src="./permanent-clip--charging.gif"/>

Note: the charging red bars are using hex `0xFF0000`, when the display is not viewed head on, the color changes.

### Reason

This one is so that I don't have to take the monocle out of the case/attach/reposition it on the monocle. Currently I don't take the monocle outside/just use it indoors when I cook food/wait for an hour every night.

So I'm going to make this work... then the monocle will just remain attached to my glasses in such a way that I can close the glasses arms and rest it on a thing and it'll charge.

### Disclaimer

Be careful with the monocle clip, in my case throughout the process of modifying/printing the clip around 30 times and detaching/re-attaching the monocle to the round peg thing... I ended up breaking it from repeated stressing.

Also... in order to ensure a guaranteed connection with the back pogo pins, I soldered the wires onto the pogo pins on the back of the monocle.
