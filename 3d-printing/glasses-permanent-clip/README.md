### About

This one is so that I don't have to take the monocle out of the case/attach/reposition it on the monocle. Currently I don't take the monocle outside/just use it indoors when I cook food/wait for an hour every night.

So I'm going to make this work... then the monocle will just remain attached to my glasses in such a way that I can close the glasses arms and rest it on a thing and it'll charge.
