okay... I need to wrap this up, dropped 3 days on it

all just screwing around/printing... the TL;DR is if you move the lens up/you have to rotate it/move the thing farther away from your eyes = less crisp text/double vision/light red fading

so... it is best to just use it as is... but that's not great with regard to it being designed to look down towards the ground to use or to tilt your head up

so I will commit and see this through... use bigger text when it's available and also not use it as a teleprompter/way to read large blocks of text or use chunks of words

I have not done any work with the actual FPGA/CV stuff with this thing yet... just cool buzzwords on my part

I'm going to design the magnetic plug now

broke the clip

making a round thing with swivel hole

still working on this... shifting back the monocle so it's not farther away and rotating in Z direction to focus the text edges

Not sure by how much, very little I think 1 degree to the right (brings right edge closer to eye)

I am still tweaking/printing... I see to be going backwards and forwards

The issue is when you raise the monocle up higher in your FOV, you have to tilt it away from you... whihc you'd think geometrically it should be the same right?

Anwyay the problem is I'm either seeing white text turn a little pink in certain areas or there's double edges on text... and blurrier

The fix for some of that is changing color and increasing font size... also not to read a wall of text like a prompter

Each print started out about 20 some minutes, now they're between 39-41 minutes

I did design the magnetic connector but I have to finish it tomorrow once I settle on this glasses mount
