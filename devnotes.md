just killing time, at this point I've switched to black fillament which is convenient, that looks better

I decided to not use the magnetic charging thing anymore, since the monocle does stop working after several hours of being on

Aside from that, it takes away from the original design where it was this thing that sits in a case/charges and you pull it out when needed

I unfortunately broke my clip off so that's why I'm using the clip design on my spare glasses

I did remove the soldered wires to the pogo contacts so it can go back into the case

The monocle no longer stays on as long as it can/back to normal use

I'm working on improving the clip design since it currently can fall out of the socket thing (monocle ring mount)

At least these are quick to print/try out and I have time to kill today

the black filament looks good, more discrete

the frame could be angled downwards more but I can compensate with "glue" (shudders) on the connection points, it looks great though in black
